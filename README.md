ðŸ¤– Welcome to my collection of machine learning algorithms using real-life datasets! ðŸ“Š
In this repository, I've curated a diverse set of machine learning models implemented in Python, each trained and tested using real-world datasets. From classic algorithms like linear regression and decision trees to cutting-edge deep learning architectures, this collection covers a wide range of techniques.
